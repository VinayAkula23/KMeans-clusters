# Project Title:
Analysis of prediction of "small_customers.csv"of american mall markets called as phonic small.To find out how many customers are visited to a paricular shop on basic of this prediction of annual income Versus spending scores.
# Disclaimers:
In this particular dataset we assume annual income as centroid and spending score from the range 1-100 called as datanode of cluster
## Problem Statement:
The American finance market as per the GDP of 2011"phonix_trillums"as in rangeout 5.The owner of the mall wants to be exact which particular shop or product search in different types of clusters in entire mall
As a data science engineer predict the futuristic financial for the upcoming gdp rate based on No.of clusters.the client wants atleast 5 top clusters(shop)

# References:
The model building algorithm devdelop for all kinds of clusteration values.The yellow spot represents the "CENTROID" which is max of 3.
# Conclusion:
According to the model basic predictuion using machine learning algorithm kmeans clustering we found the cluter 1 is in red colour is heighest cluster which attach more than 50 data nodes
